0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

	TASKS
0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.

1. Base class
Write the first class Base:
Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py
 inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

2. First Rectange
Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base

3. Validate attribute
Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)

4. Area first
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self):
 that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
